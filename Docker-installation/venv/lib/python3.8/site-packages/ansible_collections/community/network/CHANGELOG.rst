v4.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is major release 4.0.0 of ``community.network``, released on 2022-05-27.

Major Changes
-------------

- The community.network collection no longer supports Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10. While we take no active measures to prevent usage, we will remove compatibility code and other compatility measures that will effectively prevent using most content from this collection with Ansible 2.9, and some content of this collection with ansible-base 2.10. Both Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 will very soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to ansible-core 2.11 or later as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/426).

Minor Changes
-------------

- community.network.ce_switchport - add support of decode a few stdout values from bitmap to human readable format(https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/issues/315)
